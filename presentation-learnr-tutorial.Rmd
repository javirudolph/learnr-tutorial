# Tutorial Template

## Contents

```{r echo = F}

```

# Editing the template

Website: <https://github.com/R-Ladies-Gainesville/tutorials>

Clone repository or download ZIP (click `Code`).

Open `tutorial_template.Rmd` in RStudio.

Edit the metadata at the top with your name.

Press `Knit` in RStudio to see the template.

.footnote[Note: The tutorial may have R code you don't recognize. Focus on the template structure, but let us know if the code inhibits you from following the template.]

---

# Examples

We want our examples to be **informative** and **reproducible**. Consider the audience, your learning objectives, and your narrative when writing examples.

Components:
- Problem or goal
- Dataset
- Solution code
- Information for reproducibility

---

# Dataset

**Create-your-own:**

```{r}
x <- c(1, 5, 9, 10)

set.seed(20)
y <- rnorm(4)
```

--

**Built-in:**

```{r}
# data() # commented out to avoid data list loading

head(iris)
```

---

# Dataset

Another great example dataset is 'penguins'
```{r}
# install the package if it's not already installed
if(!("palmerpenguins" %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"]))
  install.packages("palmerpenguins")

# load package
library(palmerpenguins)

# show data
head(penguins)
```

---

# Solution code

We will use an example from the [palmerpenguins vignette](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html) to demonstrate solution code. For this example, the goal is to create a scatterplot for data with different categories.

--

**Load packages** 

We use the code chunk option "message = F" to suppress messages generated when packages load.
```{r, message = F}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

--

**Settings**

Include figure settings, saved variables, and create-your-own datasets.
```{r}
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

---

# Solution code

**Solution**

Code to create scatterplot.
```{r, out.width = "40%", warning = F}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species), size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","darkorchid","cyan4"))
```

---

# Information for reproducibility

Session information
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

---

# Information for reproducibility

RStudio version
```{r}
rstudioapi::versionInfo()$version
```

---
